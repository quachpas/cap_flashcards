# Converting Opale XML to LaTeX flashcards <!-- omit in toc -->
## Introduction
>**If you are already familiar with the Scenari software suite, you can skip the following introduction.**

This project is backed by [*Unisciel*](http://www.unisciel.fr/), an online university creating and providing resources for secondary school pupils aged 15-18 (*lyc√©e*), students, teachers and educational institutions.
### SCENARIchain and Opale
#### What is SCENARIchain ?
SCENARIchain refers to all Scenari software that involve structured collaborative writing.

For individual use, SCENARIchain can be deployed as a desktop application.
For collaborative use, SCENARIchain can be deployed as a server. 

#### What is Opale?
Opale is a publishing chain part of the [Scenari](https://scenari.org/co/home.html) software suite. It is used to produce resources for academic training. These documents can be used for on-site, distance or blended learning. 

Opale can be used to:
- Design training modules, blending learning and evaluations activities into a single storyline.
- Produce from a single content multiple documents:
  - (web) Online course material,
  - (PDF) Printable booklet for learners
  - (HTML) Slideshows
  - (PDF) Training document
- Add rich multimedia content to the course: videos, sounds, images, diagrams, mathematical formulas (LaTeX, OpenDocument)
- Create [quizzes][quizz]: multiple choice question (MCQ), multi choice question single answer, [categorise items][categorise], [order items][order], etc.
- Create accessible training materials in web format (HTML)
- Export content compatible with [SCORM][SCORM] (SCORM 1.2, or SCORM2004) standard to distribute them either via a Learning Management System (LMS), or a MOOC platform. Please refer to the [official website](https://scorm.com/) for more details.

[SCORM]: https://trac.scenari.org/opale/wiki/scorm
[quizz]: https://moodle.utc.fr/file.php/1330/cometes-modules/cometes-module-3-advanced/cometes-module-3-parcours/co/0551_exercices_interactifs.html
[categorise]: https://moodle.utc.fr/file.php/1330/cometes-modules/cometes-module-3-advanced/cometes-module-3-parcours/co/0551a_categorisation.html
[order]: https://moodle.utc.fr/file.php/1330/cometes-modules/cometes-module-3-advanced/cometes-module-3-parcours/co/guide_advanced.html

You will find below some examples of content produced using the Opale module in different format.

### Why this script?
The aim of this script is to produce printable flashcards to be used as learning support material for undergraduate students mainly. The format used is 10x8cm. You can find an example file [here](./LaTeX/flashcard_1x1.pdf).

It can also be used to produce printable flashcards at home for students' personal use. (A4 paper format). Please refer to the example [file](./LaTeX/flashcard_2x3.pdf) given in the LaTeX folder for more details.

Find below the front and the back of a flashcard. 

**Please note that the examples are models that were produced at the beginning of the project as a first design of the flashcard and are OUTDATED. Some additional changes have been made since, including adding correct answers checkboxes on the back of the flashcard. Some other changes may or may not be made in the future.**

## Project's roadmap
- The script is a POC, therefore some functionalities may not work perfectly. Please use the debugging tools to check the validity of the produced flashcards before printing or sending into production.
### To do list
- Short tasks
  - A short text and a QR code are added automatically at the back of the flashcard. Add an option to disable it.
  - Add option to disable choice explanation's output. 
- Moderately long tasks
  - Image suppport is limited, as it's always put on the right side of the text. Better image support.
  - The icon is included in all flashcards. Implement a system to handle different icons according to which subject the flashcard has.
  - As of now, only one document is given "out.pdf" as the script's output. Categorised output will be added (sorted by subject, errors flashcards, etc.).
  - Template LaTeX flashcards' better
    - Transfer a4paper positions to Python, to prepare for an eventual move to a configuration file.
    - Create a new command for solutions boxes.
- Long tasks
  - The QR code is static, a dynamic QR code generation according to the ressources found in the source file may be added in the future.
  - Write a configuration file template (YAML?) to implement:
    - custom short text on the back of the flashcard
    - custom subject/licence_theme dictionary and complexity_level dictionary 
    - QR Code toggle
    - etc.
    - Expected behaviour:
      - Set default values to the script console options 
      - console options should override configuration file
## Getting Started
The root folder contains:
- [LICENSE](LICENSE), the license file.
- [README.md](README.md), this file.

There are three folders in this repository : Example files, LaTeX and Python. 

* The LaTeX folder is a playground for templating flashcards using the script. It contains basic examples and the models used for creating flashcards.
* The Python folder contains the script, two headers for two distinct ouput format and one footer. It also has some basic icons.
* The Example files folder contains `themeLicence.xml`, `9047.quiz`, and `8983.quiz` and folders leading to the image resource used by `9047.quiz`. 

### Prerequisites
The script has only been tested on a linux system so far (Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS). If all dependencies are installed, it should probably work seamlessly. You might need to tweak a few settings for `inkscape` to work properly.

Here is the latexmk tool I use in VS Code's LaTeX Workshop:
```json
"name": "latexmk",
"command": "latexmk",
"args": [
    "-xelatex",
    "-synctex=1",
    "-interaction=nonstopmode",
    "-file-line-error",
    "-outdir=%OUTDIR%",
    "--shell-escape",
    "-cd",
    "%DOC%"
]
```

The recipe calls that tool once.

#### Linux systems
Install `python3` if needed and `inkscape` ([Installation guide](https://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/Installing_Inkscape#Installing_on_Linux)), these are required packages.

I use `latexmk`to compile my `.tex` files. The following packages are optional : `latexmk` ([Installation guide](https://mg.readthedocs.io/latexmk.html))(necessary to use the `--compile` option). Perl often comes preinstalled, if it's not the case, please refer to the [perl official website](https://www.perl.org/get.html#unix_like).
You may need to update your packages.

```bash
apt update
apt install libcanberra-gtk-module libcanberra-gtk3-module
apt install inkscape
apt install latexmk
apt install texlive-xetex
```

#### Windows
Install `python3` ([Installation guide](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html)) and `inkscape` ([Installation guide](https://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/Installing_Inkscape#Installing_on_a_Windows_system)).

Optional : You can install `latexmk` through MikTex on Windows. If MikTex is not already installed, please follow this [link](https://miktex.org/download). `latemxk` needs Perl, you can install [Strawberry Perl](http://strawberryperl.com/).

> It hasn't been tested yet. 

#### macOS
MacOS comes with Python 2.7 pre-installed. Since this script has been tested on Python 3, please update your version of Python if it's already not up-to-date. You can find an installation guide here : [MacPython](https://docs.python.org/3/using/mac.html).

Inkscape is used to include `.svg` files. Here is an installation guide, and a faq : [installation guide and faq](https://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/Installing_Inkscape#Installing_on_a_Mac).

Optional : `latexmk` is probably already installed. If not, follow instructions [here](https://miktex.org/howto/install-miktex-mac).

> It hasn't been tested yet.

### Installing and first test run

Clone the repository where you want it to be and set it as your current working directory.

```
git clone https://gitlab.utc.fr/quachpas/cap_flashcards/
cd  ./cap_flashcards
```
At this point, if you want to run the script, you need source files. There is a sample provided in the folder [Example files](/Example-files/).

Open a terminal and run the script.
> For now, you need an XML files with all themes. There is one provided in the repository for example's sake. Please adjust as necessary. 

```
python3 ./Python/opale2flashcard.py ./Examples-files ./Examples-files/themeLicence.xml
```

The output will be in `./cap_flashcards/Python/output/out.tex`.
## How to use the script?
### General instructions
The script works in collaboration with SCENARIchain.
You will need the following:
- Source files: the sources files **must be mcqSur or mcqMur quizzes** XML files, which you can download from your SCENARIchain server using the export option or export from your SCENARIchain desktop app. Find more details in the [Getting started](#getting-started) section.
- Licence theme file: as seen above, the flashcards each have a **subject** and a **theme**. As these are stored in the form of a code (#subj-them) in the source file, we need to produce a dictionary with all valid associations. This dictionary can be hard-coded in the script in the `opale_to_tex` function.
- Media resources: 
  - Compulsory resources are the subject logo (upper left) and university's logo (bottom right on the front). 
    > Both of these **must be** SVG files.
  - an icon and a logo are provided by default in [Python/output/images](./Python/output/images). 
> The script uses some tags that are present in Opale's document models **mcqSur** and **mcqMur**. Please find Opale's documentation [here](https://download.scenari.software/Opale@3.7/).

## Contributing

I'm open to any contributions. I am a complete beginner in regards to coding, and I am aware that my code has several design issues.
Some parts might need to be completely refactored.
